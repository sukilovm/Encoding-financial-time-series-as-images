This repository contains the code implemented in the course of my master's thesis "Encoding financial time series as images – Application of image classification to predict stock price directions of the S&P 500 Index". For a more detailed explanation of the concepts and methodologies used, please refer to the thesis paper.

**Thesis_Data**: Generates the raw time series data of the Constituents Dataset. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sukilovm/Encoding-financial-time-series-as-images/blob/main/Thesis_Data.ipynb)
 <br>
**Thesis_Images**: Encodes the raw time series of the Constituents Dataset as images. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sukilovm/Encoding-financial-time-series-as-images/blob/main/Thesis_Images.ipynb) <br>
**Thesis_Models**: Fits models and predicts on the Constituents Dataset. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sukilovm/Encoding-financial-time-series-as-images/blob/main/Thesis_Models.ipynb)<br>
**Thesis_Trading**: Loads models fitted on the Constituents Dataset to predict on the Index Dataset.
